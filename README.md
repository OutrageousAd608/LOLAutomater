This program allows you to get a snack while waiting for a league of legends game.

This code is very simple and is written in python. This code will automatically accept a queue
for you when you are queueing for a league of legends game.

**How to use**
<ul>
  <li>Keep the program running when you leave to do something (use the washroom, grab a snack, etc.)</li>
  <li>Terminate the program after joining a game (or you may lag. Personally, I despise playing video games with bad wifi. I'd rather study)</li>
</ul>
